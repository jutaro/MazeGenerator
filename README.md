MazeGenerator
=============

A 2D maze generator with OpenGL display in Haskell.

This program is published for its (hopefully) educational value.
Its aim is to give an example of how a (naive) implementation of
an algorithm is still perfectly readable in plain Haskell code.

The example chosen was [Depth-first search w/ recursive backtracking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation#Recursive_backtracker).
Please refer to comments inside the program text to see how the pieces all comes together.
